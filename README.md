# Word Typer
## Idea
A python program with a simple gui to type over words.

## Features:
* Select word list
* Shuffled list

## Installation
* Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, together with the tkinter module
* Clone or download this repository, and run the main file `main.py`

## Usage
* After starting the program, any file can be chosen to pick out words, as long as there is only 1 word on each line. If there are multiple words on a line, this line will be seen as 1 word, and may not fit on the screen.
